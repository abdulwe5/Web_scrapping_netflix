For a project titled "Movie Recommendation Using Beautiful Soup", the goal is to create a movie recommendation system by scraping movie data from popular sites. Here’s a structured summary of the project:

Project Overview
This project uses Beautiful Soup, a Python library for web scraping, to gather data on movies, including titles, genres, ratings, descriptions, and more, from a chosen movie website. After collecting this data, you’ll organize and analyze it to build a recommendation system.

Objectives
Data Collection: Scrape essential movie information (e.g., title, genre, ratings, release date) using Beautiful Soup.
Data Processing: Clean and structure the scraped data for analysis.
Recommendation Algorithm: Develop an algorithm to suggest movies based on user preferences, such as genre, rating, or popularity.

Key Steps
Scrape Data: Use Beautiful Soup to extract data from <div>, <span>, and <td> tags based on specific classes and IDs on a movie website.
Data Storage: Save the data into a structured format (like a CSV file or database).
Implement Filtering Logic: Build filtering options that recommend movies based on the stored data, such as sorting by rating or genre.
Output Recommendations: Present the recommended movies to users based on their input.
Tools and Technologies
Python: For scripting and logic.
Beautiful Soup: For web scraping.
Pandas (optional): For data storage and manipulation.

Expected Outcome
A functional movie recommendation system that provides users with tailored movie suggestions based on scraped data. This project demonstrates data scraping, cleaning, and recommendation-building techniques, making it an excellent practical application of Beautiful Soup in Python.
